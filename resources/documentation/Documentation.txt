	-redid the navigation bars etc

5-11: I took out the positioning for the tabs on the homepage. This was where they would automatically grab to the right of the screen at certain browser widths-go for simplicity
	-to put this back in, be sure to consider how it will effect the about box
	-fixed the about box-can continue to change the effect/speed
	*CONTACT BOX*
		-grow the width out from the right
			-then it expands up...
			-for now, just using the show/hide(time) animation
		-took out the hover in contact changing the opacity...		
			


5-12
	-I think there is too much movement with the contact box
		-too many curves?
		-to big of font
		-just attach the images as little fliers off the side?
			-one image but on hover the background color is the light gray!
				-these are just divs inside of divs?
5-17
	-phone, twitter, facebook, linkedin icons
		-its best to have one sprite for each image to allow for resizing, otherwise there are problems
				-ie:have a hover etc! and then set the background position
	-CONTACT BUTTONS:ON CLICK, THE CONTACT BUTTON IS CHANGED TO THE CURRENT ONE
