	<p>Jon is currently working with a wide variety of web-development programming languages. Front-end, he is using a lot of javascript and CSS3. BackBone.js is a current interest as he is diving into front-end, javascript based MVC development for immersive applications. Also a designer, Jon works with the latest technologies available and is currently working on his own library to extend the popular Jquery library. Jon is a firm believer in minimalization while coding and prefers to create his own libraries in Javascript using Jquery rather than using publicly released Jquery plugins. </p>
