<h1>Current Projects ... Objective-C Programming</h1>

<p>I'm currently working with Objective-C. After I took a class in C++ and learned the basics of object-oriented-programming last semester, my development as a programmer has taken off.</p>

<p>I'm currently immersed in building a database-driven 'wiki' app for iOS devices. I'm hoping this application can serve as an easy way for communication between my clients and I as we develop together.</p>

<p>I'm also using some Python server-side to help monitor and maintain my database. I'm still deciding whether or not to use NoSQL or SQL for this project and could even use both in the future...</p>
