<h1>Current Projects ... General Web Development</h1>

<p>I've been trying to learn as much as possible about all the different languages currently being used around the web. I have experience in Ruby, Python, PHP and some Javascript for server side scripting.</p>

<p>I'm fascinated in the difference in culture of each of the different programming environments and the community behind them. I work primarily in PHP for now but definitely want to keep expanding my horizons.</p>
