**HAVE A FILE THAT IS CONSTANTLY BEING WRITTEN WITH PHP**
	-editable content
		-when you press save, it will send that to the server ('value') and then would write the data to a file or database...
		-basic html/css that would go into the formatting
			-or would it be better to have a complex system of files storing the information
				-or the whole tag item thing?

-use the 'get html' from jquery
	-constantly sending the html back and forth between the two
		-then when you save/commit changes it saves the html to a page and will then be easily stored as html...
